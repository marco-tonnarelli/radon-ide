## RADON Stack

This folder contains the different version of the *devfiles* we implemented to define the RADON Stack.
The latest version of the RADON Stack is provided in the *latest* folder and includes the following elements:

- A project (named *radon-particles*) that clones in the RADON workspace the TOSCA modeling entities from the RADON Particles GitHub repository;
- The set of *Che plugins* (i.e., VT, DT, DPT, CTT, xOpera SaaS, TL, CI/CD chePlugins) and *Kubernetes* components (i.e., GMT, VT, CTT Kubernetes container) that have been developed to implement custom commands and backend services to interact with the integrated RADON tools.
